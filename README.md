# scSignalMap: scRNA-Seq Ligand–Receptor Signaling Analysis in R
 > scSignalmap performs a **full ligand–receptor signaling analysis** for single-cell RNA sequencing data. Utilizing user-defined parameters, it performs a streamlined workflow including: 

 - Ligand–receptor interaction mapping
 - Differential expression analysis
 - Receptor filtering
 - Receptor–ligand intersection 
 - Pathway enrichment analysis
